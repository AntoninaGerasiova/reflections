How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can easily check all changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I become more brave and experiment more easily. I can easyly fix bugs without wasting time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think I like both. Manual choosing helps kepp logic clear, but I whant the very last changes to be saved automatically (not in commit);

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Savin multiple files in one commit is handy for programming, couse these changes can be related, and programm maybe can't even compile with only one file changed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can read through commit message to find target changes using log. Or I can compare two commits and see what has been changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I alway can locate and fix the bag not spendin much time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it for push my project to github
